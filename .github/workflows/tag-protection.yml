          ## 🚫 Manual Tag Creation Blocked
          
          **Tag:** \`$TAG_NAME\`  
          **Created by:** @$CREATOR  
          **Time:** $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")  
          **Event:** ${{ github.event_name }}  
          **Workflow Run:** [${{ github.run_id }}](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})  
          **Deletion Status:** $DELETION_STATUS
          
          ### ❌ What happened?
          The tag \`$TAG_NAME\` was created manually and our automation detected it.
          **Action taken:** Attempted automatic deletion.
          
          ### 🔍 Detection Details
          - **Actor:** ${{ github.actor }}
          - **Event:** ${{ github.event_name }}
          - **Tag Commit:** $TAG_COMMIT
          - **No automation markers found in tag or recent commits**
          
          ### ✅ How to create releases properly?
          
          **Option 1: Use the Automated Release Workflow**
          1. Go to **[Actions → Automated Release](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/workflows/automated-release.yml)**
          2. Click **"Run workflow"**
          3. Enter the version number (e.g., \`1.0.3\`)
          4. Click **"Run workflow"**
          
          **Option 2: Update VERSION file and merge PR**
          1. Create a feature branch
          2. Update the \`VERSION\` file with your desired version (e.g., \`1.0.3\`)
          3. Create and merge a PR to main/master
          4. Release will be created automatically
          
          ### 🔧 Why this restriction exists?
          - ✅ Ensures consistent release process
          - ✅ Automatically generates changelogs
          - ✅ Maintains proper version history
          - ✅ Prevents accidental or malformed releases
          - ✅ Tracks release triggers and contexts
          
          ### 🚨 If this was a legitimate automated release
          If you believe this tag was created by automation but was incorrectly flagged:
          1. Check that your automation includes the \`[automated-release]\` marker
          2. Verify the tag annotation contains automation markers
          3. Contact the DevOps team for investigation
          
          ### 📋 Need help?
          - Check the repository's release documentation
          - Contact the DevOps team
          - Review existing releases for examples
