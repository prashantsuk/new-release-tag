          ## 🚫 Manual Tag Creation Blocked
          
          **Tag:** \`$TAG_NAME\`  
          **Created by:** @$CREATOR  
          **Time:** $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")
          
          ### ❌ What happened?
          The tag \`$TAG_NAME\` was automatically deleted because it was created manually.
          
          ### ✅ How to create releases properly?
          1. Go to **Actions** → **Automated Release**
          2. Click **"Run workflow"**
          3. Enter the version number (e.g., \`1.0.0\`)
          4. Click **"Run workflow"**
          
          ### 🔧 Why this restriction?
          - Ensures consistent release process
          - Automatically generates changelogs
          - Maintains proper version history
          - Prevents accidental or malformed releases
